In this project, I created a web page using R Markdown that features a map of the location of Empire State Building in NYC created with Leaflet.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
library(magrittr)
m <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  
  addMarkers(lng=-73.985428, lat=40.748817,
    popup="Empire State Building")
```
